## PID Controller

The PID controller is defined with 3 different types control: proportional, differential and integral.

The PID controller using coefficients which allows the affects of each factors to be combined and output a good outcome.

Fine tuning a PID controller is an important and challenging problem in this project. Firstly, I use the way to understand each elements physical meaning by setting one only coefficients to 0.1 and other twos into zero.

## PID Parameters Tuning

So for the first, I tried fine tuning the PID parameters by trying different combination of coefficients in the simulator, it was painful but interesting.

Then I used twiddle python script provided in the previous class as a reference, and do slightly changed manually to make the car running smoothly.

However, I didnt have enough time to fine tune the higher speed mode.
