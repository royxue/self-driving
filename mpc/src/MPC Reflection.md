## MPC Model

The MPC model includes the following state variables:

**State variables**
- x - the x position of the vehicle in the vehicle's grid map.
- y - the y position of the vehicle in the vehicle's grid map.
- psi - the relative vehicles orientation (vehicles coordinate system)
- velocity - the vehicle's velocity in the direction of psi.
- cross-track error
- psi error

**Actuations**
- steering - in range of (-0.43 : 0.43) radians (-25 : 25 degrees).
- throttle - in range of (-1.0 : 1.0).

**Constraints**
The cost function tries to minimize these constrains:
- cross track error
- psi error
- error in velocity vs. target speed
- changes in steering actuator.
- changes in throttle actuator.

## Timestep length and Elapsed duration between timesteps (N & dt)
I tried different combinations of values of N and dt, to provide the best output manuslly.

The values for N and dt that I tried N from 5 to 20 and dt from 0.05 to 0.2. Finally I think the combination with N = 10 and dt = 0.1 works best for me

## Polynomial Fitting and MPC Preprocessing

The trajectory waypoints are converted from the global/map coordinate system to the vehicles's coordinate system. 

The transformation:
```
          // calculate the cross track error by evaluating the polynomial at x = px
          // and subtracting y = 0.
          double cte = polyeval(coeffs, px);// error in track

          //psi is the angle with relation to the track
          double epsi = psi - atan(coeffs[1] + coeffs[2]*px + coeffs[3]*px*px);//
```
The transformation actually simplifies the calculations for cross track error and psi error because initial values for x and y relative to the vehicle are always zero.


## Model Predictive Control with Latency
The main idea to deal with the latency is to project the vehicleâ€™s state by one latency period ahead. This is done by the basic kinetic model calculation.
